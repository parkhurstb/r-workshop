# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R using ggplot2 package from tidyverse.

We will install these packages:

- tidyverse - suite of packages for wangling and visualization (ggplot)
- readxl - to read in excel files (in many ways)
- here - help with files paths

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse) #install.packages("tidyverse")
library(here)##install.packages("here")
library(readxl) #install.packages ("readxl")

```
